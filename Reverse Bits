### Aim  
To reverse the bits of a given **32-bit unsigned integer** and return the resulting integer.  

### Objective:
1. Extract each bit from the given 32-bit integer and construct the reversed bit sequence.  
2. Ensure correct binary representation by shifting and combining bits appropriately.  
3. Optimize the solution to handle multiple function calls efficiently.  
4. Consider edge cases, such as inputs with all bits set or only one bit set.  
5. Return the reversed bit integer as an unsigned 32-bit value.

### Code:
class Solution {
public:
    uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
        uint32_t result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int bit = n & 1;      
            result = (result << 1) | bit; 
            n = n >> 1;           
        }
        return result;
    }
};
